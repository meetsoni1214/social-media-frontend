# Project: AI Social Media Generator Frontend

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15.5+ (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript 5+
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components
- class-variance-authority (cva)
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Lucide React icons

## Core Principles

### Code Style & Comments

- Comment "why" not "what" - code should be self-descriptive
- Avoid unnecessary comments that explain obvious code
- Use comments to explain business logic, non-obvious decisions, or workarounds
- Keep code clean, readable, and maintainable

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript with proper typing
- Prefer interfaces for props with `extends React.ComponentProps`
- Use type inference where possible
- Export types/interfaces that may be reused
- Use Zod schemas for form validation and runtime type checking

### React Patterns

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use `React.forwardRef` for components that need ref forwarding
- Always set `displayName` on forwardRef components
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use proper React 19 patterns (avoid deprecated features)

### Component Structure

- Place reusable UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- Place custom/branded components in `src/components/`
- Use page components in `src/app/` following Next.js App Router conventions
- Organize by feature when project grows

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- For now over designl only for the light mode
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use the custom gradient theme colors:
  - `--gradient-orange`: #ff6b35
  - `--gradient-pink`: #ff1493
  - `--gradient-purple`: #9b59b6
- Apply gradient via `from-[var(--gradient-orange)] via-[var(--gradient-pink)] to-[var(--gradient-purple)]`
- Use `gradient-text` class for text with gradient
- Use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
- Prefer using components which are already there under components folder. If not present, create a new component, keeping in mind of reusability and scalability.
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS

### Component Variants (CVA)

- Use `class-variance-authority` for component variants
- Define variants with `cva()` and export variant types
- Use `VariantProps<typeof variantName>` for typing
- Provide sensible `defaultVariants`
- Common variant types: `variant`, `size`, `state`

### Custom Component Patterns

- **GradientButton**: Use for primary CTAs with gradient styling
  - Variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `ghost`
  - Sizes: `default`, `sm`, `lg`, `icon`
- **GradientCard**: Use for content cards with gradient accents
  - Variants: `default`, `highlighted`, `selected`
  - Includes subcomponents: `GradientCardHeader`, `GradientCardTitle`, `GradientCardDescription`

### Forms

- Use React Hook Form for form state management
- Use Zod for schema validation with `@hookform/resolvers/zod`
- Integrate with shadcn/ui form components
- Provide clear validation error messages

### File Naming

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `GradientButton.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `utils.ts`)
- Pages: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `business-profile/page.tsx`)
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase with descriptive names

### Imports

- Use `@/` path alias for imports from `src/`
- Group imports: external packages → internal components → types → styles
- Use named imports where possible

### Next.js Specific

- Use App Router conventions (app directory)
- Use Server Components by default, mark Client Components with `"use client"`
- Leverage Next.js 15 features (Turbopack, React 19 support)
- Use `next/link` for navigation
- Optimize images with `next/image` when appropriate

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide proper ARIA labels where needed
- Maintain color contrast ratios
- Test focus states on interactive elements

### Performance

- Keep components small and focused
- Use React.memo() judiciously for expensive components
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Lazy load heavy components when appropriate

### State Management

- Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for local state
- Consider Context API for shared state across multiple components
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

### Error Handling

- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle loading and error states in UI
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Validate user inputs before submission

### Testing Considerations

- Write testable, pure functions when possible
- Keep business logic separate from UI components
- Use descriptive test-friendly data attributes if needed

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Brand Theme

- Maintain consistent gradient usage (orange → pink → purple)
- Use soft pastel backgrounds: `from-orange-50 via-pink-50 to-purple-50`
- Apply gradient accent line at top of pages
- Ensure gradient animations are smooth with transition classes

### Social Media Context

- Focus on content generation features
- Prioritize user input forms for business profiles and content details
- Display generated content in visually appealing cards
- Support multiple social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)

### User Experience

- Provide immediate visual feedback on interactions
- Use loading states for AI generation
- Show progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Implement smooth transitions and animations with Tailwind

## Code Quality

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Extract repeated logic into utility functions or custom hooks
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write self-documenting code that minimizes need for comments
